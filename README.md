# SSG-LLI-Internship-2024
Code repo for my projects during my time at SSG-LLI.

During this internship, I was tasked with using AI to perform text classification. 
As the data was extremely varied and unstructured, traditional algorithms such as Naive-Bayes, Random Forest, KNN and so on were not cutting it. As such, this repo contains the milestones in my journey to achieve a high accuracy in text classification using AI models. 

I tried several models, both paid and unpaid, including: 
- SetFit: A few shot learning model available on HuggingFace
- DistillBert: A smaller version of the BERT AI model used in the Google search engine
- Llama3: Meta's most advanced chat bot (at the time)
- ChatGPT: OpenAI's crown jewel

I also trid several techniques, including: 
- Fine-tuning ChatGPT using training and validation data
- Hyperparameter Optimization using Optuna
- Both single and multi-class classification for all the models
- Prompt Engineering
- Creating a pipeline of AI Models

In the end, I managed to secure an 80% accuracy for my classification task.
